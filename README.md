An end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to predict the probability of a client's loan default. This project bridges the gap between complex data science modeling and real-world deployment using a modular **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** architecture.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. This project utilizes historical loan application data to predict whether an applicant will have difficulties repaying their loan.

### Key Features:
* **Single Prediction Mode:** Interactive UI to input individual applicant data and receive a real-time risk score.
* **Batch Prediction Mode (CSV):** High-volume automated processing allowing users to upload CSV files (e.g., `application_test.csv`) and download full results.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated **SHAP Values** to interpret model decisions, ensuring transparency in credit scoring.
* **Smart Risk Rating:** Automated categorization into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High Risk** with actionable business recommendations and system messages.

## 📉 Business Insights & Strategic Decision Making

This project goes beyond technical accuracy by aligning model outputs with core banking KPIs and risk management strategies. The goal is to optimize the balance between **Loan Growth** and **Credit Loss Mitigation**.

### 🔍 1. Key Risk Drivers (Feature Interpretability)
Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), the model identifies the most influential factors driving credit default:

* **Financial Health (Payment Rate):** The model heavily penalizes high payment-to-income ratios. High-risk candidates typically have an annuity-to-credit ratio that suggests an unsustainable debt burden.
* **External Credibility (EXT_SOURCES):** Normalized scores from external providers act as a proxy for financial reputation. A low average across these sources is the strongest indicator of potential delinquency.
* **Employment Stability (Days Employed):** The model detects a non-linear relationship where longer tenure in current employment significantly reduces the probability of default, reflecting the importance of income stability.

### 🛡️ 2. Risk-Based Action Plan (The Strategy)
To optimize operational efficiency, the application categorizes applicants into a **Tri-Tier Risk System**:

| Risk Category | Probability Range | Business Strategy | Operational Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🟢 Low Risk** | < 30% | **Auto-Approval** | Zero human intervention; maximizes customer experience and reduces operational overhead. |
| **🟡 Medium Risk** | 30% - 60% | **Conditional Offer / Manual Review** | Request additional collateral or verify income via physical documents. Risk-based pricing (higher interest) may be applied. |
| **🔴 High Risk** | > 60% | **Immediate Rejection** | Prevents Non-Performing Loans (NPL) and protects the bank's capital reserves. |

### 📈 3. Strategic Value for Home Credit
* **Expansion to the Unbanked:** By using non-traditional features (like employment duration and goods price ratios), the model allows Home Credit to safely lend to individuals without a traditional credit history.
* **Profitability Optimization:** By accurately identifying Low-Risk individuals, the bank can offer faster approvals and lower interest rates, gaining a competitive edge in the market.
* **Regulatory Compliance (XAI):** Using Explainable AI (SHAP) ensures that the bank can provide a "Reason for Denial" to applicants, fulfilling transparency requirements set by central bank regulations.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

### **Core Technologies**
* **Modeling:** LightGBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) with Hyperparameter Tuning.
* **XAI:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
* **Backend:** FastAPI (High-performance Python web framework).
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Interactive Data Dashboard).
* **Containerization:** Docker (Multi-process orchestration).

### **Modular OOP Design**
The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure maintainability and scalability:
* `DataTransformer`: A dedicated class for feature engineering (26 features), robust median imputation, and vectorized log transformations.
* `CreditPredictor`: Manages model inference, risk thresholding logic, and business insight mapping.
* `Schemas`: Utilizes **Pydantic** for rigorous data validation and automatic Swagger documentation.

## 📊 Model Interpretability (XAI)

This model is built on transparency. Using SHAP Values, the system identifies key risk drivers for each prediction. Global analysis shows that EXT_SOURCE ratings, PAYMENT_RATE, and DAYS_EMPLOYED are the most significant factors in determining repayment probability.
